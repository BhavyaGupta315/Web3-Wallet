# Web 3 Wallet
I created a Web 3 based Wallet where we can generate our owm Seed Phrase/Mnemonics and by the concept of HD Wallets, we can create different private/public keypairs from the same seed.
## How to Install
``` 
git clone https://github.com/BhavyaGupta315/Web3-Wallet.git
```
Install all the dependencies
```
npm install 
```

As of 1st commit, this is only react based.

Also Added Functionality to check balances.
Now You can Also check Balances by providing your public key.
